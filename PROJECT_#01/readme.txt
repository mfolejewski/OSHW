OSHW PCB PROJECT #01: Resistor Decade 1 Ohm - 1 MOhm

Open Hardware World! I have a message for you!
This is my first open-source hardware project (OSHW).

Please share, download, copy, modify... whatever you want :-)

Download project from my GitHub page:
https://lnkd.in/dzCPVMg

If you can support me - you can buy my bare PCBs or assembled PCB :-)

Stay tuned, it will be more advanced open-sourced hardware from me!
This is only the beginning!
